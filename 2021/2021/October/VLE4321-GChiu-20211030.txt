Renee was seen in clinic with her husband today.  She still has this chronic discharge from her left ear which is showing Candida parasilosis and I see that she has a phone consultation with ID thisWednesday.  She had her 7th Cyclophosphamide infusion last week.  She has had both COVID-19 vaccinations, the last one 2 months ago.

I gave her a consent form and a prescription for her 3rd primary Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination as she is immunosuppressed.  However, she may not be able to make antibodies to this and hopefully she will get some from the Intragram if it has been harvested recently enough.  

Interestingly, I see that her renal function has improved with her creatinine falling to 60 and also her ACR normalising, as well as her urinary albumin disappearing to < 3mg/L, suggesting that she may have had some occult renal disease as well.  She thinks her problems started in 2010 when she had a renal abscess or inflammatory mass.

The ENT examination also suggests some improvement with the retronasal space lesion almost resolved.  

I am wondering if she is re-infecting herself with her hearing aid and I have asked her to take it out except for when she needs it to go to work.  She did try Kenacomb drops but after 3 days, she developed increasing deafness so discontinued this.  

She can drop the prednisone to 20 mg today and then to 15 mg in another couple of weeks.

We will see her in a month’s time. 


Yours sincerely
