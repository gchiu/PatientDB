Dear Dr Shaheed 

Diagnoses: 
Psoriatic arthritis 
- CCP > 300, RF +ve
E-cadherin mutation carrier. 
- Sister died with stomach cancer aged 38 
- Has declined prophylactic gastrectomy 
Medications: 
Leflunomide 20mg daily 
Methotrexate 20mg once weekly 
Folic Acid 0.8mg daily 
Prednisone 7.5mg daily *reducing to 6mg and taper 1mg per month*
DMARDS:
Methotrexate started
Leflunomide added
Prednisone from onset

Vitals:
Weight 90.3kg, BP 125/72mmHg, saturation 100%, HR 81bpm 

Woman is much better with the Methotrexate.  She has lost most of the swelling present in her hands apart from a little bit in the right index DIP joint.  She has also lost the DIP joint tenderness.  She had a small ganglion in the base of the left one.  

She was asking about whether she could have another child but she would have to be off the Leflunomide for 2 years and off the Methotrexate for at least 2 cycles of her periods.    

I think she can start to taper the Prednisone now by 1mg per month with immediate reduction to 6mg.  

Follow-up:	6 months 

Yours sincerely
