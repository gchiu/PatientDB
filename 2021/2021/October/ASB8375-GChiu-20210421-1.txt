BEVINS, Eric Leonard
NHI: ASH8375



DMARD History :
Prednisone (August 2010-2020 ?)
Methotrexate (April 2015- not tolerated/re-stated March 2018)
Hydroxychloroquine (March 2018 ? discontinuation/re-started April 2021)

Vitals :
Blood Pressure : 132/92, Weight : 74kg, Pulse : 104, Saturation : 97%   

Mr Bevins is off Prednisone but it is not clear when he managed to come off this.
He is having wide spread joint pain, there is no obvious synovitis present in his upper or lower limbs.  

His main pain is his scoliosis and his back pain.  He also complained of pain in his right forefoot where he has a bunion present. His CRP is up a bit and perhaps he should be on Hydroxychloroquine.  I have restarted this at 400mg daily and hopefully this will not be a problem for him.

Follow Up:
Six months.




Yours sincerely
